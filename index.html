						<h2>Meet my Family</h2>
						<p> When I was a child my family was separated and I was get by my father while my sister is in my mother. Sometimes my sister is visiting us that's why I have these family picture but we have never had a chance to have a complete family picture.
                            My father is the one who raised me and for me he is the best dad ever. He is the most comedian but so caring and his name is Amado Castro. Even though our life is so hard he manage to grow me up with a respect in all of the people.
                            My mother name is Helen Devera and sadly she passed away shes a great mother and for me no one can replace her. 
                            I remember when I was a child even though we are separated she still supports and care for me whenever I got a chance to visit in my mother's province. And my beautiful sister whose name is Michelle Castro a very hardworking sister of mine.
                            Life is tough for both of us when we are child and got separated we never had a chance to have a conversation with each other that's why I'm thankful that the gadgets are build up because now we can communicate with each other we can now greet each and other and talk about what is happening in our lives. 
                            And lastly I also have another sister but not in my real father when my family got separated my mother had another child from different man and her name is Princess Suarez. For me she is still my sister and happy for it even though she is super playful.
                            My family might struggle a lot in my childhood days and it was never been easy for us but I'm still thankful that I had these family because these family never surrender or give up in all of that problems.

					<h2>One of my favorite hobbies is Dancing</h2>
					<p>When I was a child I don't have any talent at all. But a group of people called bangtan give me a chance to have a talent that I had now. Bangtan is a group of people who sing and dance and they are the one who inspire me to do what they do except for the singing part.
                        I always practice all of their dances and it was so hard they're choreographies is in high level and I'm just a newby who tries to learn it. But time come's I manage to learn it and had a group.
                        But that never ends in there I also learn a different kinds of dance from different groups just like seventeen, exo and wannaone etc.
                        And know so much people. But still I'm always gonna be a fan of bangtan even though I retired in dancing because of pandemic.

					<p> My especial talent is self managing which is also refered as self control in which I can control my emotion, thoughts and behaviors by different kinds of situation.
						Whenever something is going on to me I always calm myself knowing the problem and solutioning it calmly. And these is especial for me because not everyone can control their emotions
						their thoughts whenever they are angry or sad.

					<p>My skills in other hand is Teamwork skill and Problem solving. Teamwork skill because not all the time I can do the work all by myself and I'm very productive whenever there are
					a teamwork project I always listen and make sure to do my work properly. Problem solving because I love whenever I solve some problem by myself it's so refreshing
					but also a big headache although it's hard practicing these skill can develop my mind that can be very useful when the time comes.

					<h1><span class="underline">Strenght and Weaknesses</span></h1>
					<p> Data encoding. That's because I’ve experienced to be an encoder in a finance work where my friend teaches me on how they do it and work to him in the summer days.
					Since it's school days now I never got a chance to work back again at him but I've learn so much and experience a lot of things especially in microsoft excel.
					My strength As an I.T. is I’m a fast learner but for me it's not enough but it's a advantage because as an IT I should have a consistent practice in encoding and explore a lot more about it everyday. But my strength will never stop in there and I will practice a lot more of advantages to help me in my I.T field.
					My weakness is I'm so forgetful. Whenever I learn in coding in few days I will forget what the code is use for and what the code or symbol to use in making a program.
					But I'm practicing to memorize and using some notes to always remember every single code and steps to build a program.
					 In the future, I know that the path that I will choose will reveal more of my streghts and weaknesses and I will accept this strenghts and weaknesses because 
						I know that it will improve me to be a better person.
